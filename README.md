# ContextualCards
 
 This package contains a plug-and-play component (Contextual-Cards) and it's usage in application
 
 ## Idea
 
 - Developed a standalone custom view, that displays a list of `Contextual Cards`
    - A `Contextual Card` is used to refer to a view that is rendered using json from an API
    - These views are dynamic and their properties like images, color, texts, buttons (CTAs) etc. can be changed from backend at anytime.
